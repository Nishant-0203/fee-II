                <p>J.K. Rowling’s seven-book Harry Potter series deserves every bit of its historic success, but I was the last person on earth to discover it. Having read the first three novels in my teens,  I somehow put them aside and went on to other things. What an unexpected surprise it was to read all seven for the first time as an adult, and to be dying to discuss this scene or that moment with anyone who would listen. Naturally, I’ve recently been subjected to many versions of,  “Wait! You mean this is the first time you’ve read them all?!”</p>

                <p>I’m a huge fan of Marvel Comics and super hero movies. And I was really happy that I go to read this book.
                    I have been following Marvels for a long time. I have read many comics and have watched each & every movie. So, I was able to resonate much with it.
                    As for the story of this book, it’s not exactly the story from graphic novel(s), nor does it track the movie, so it’s quite the original material. Stuart Moore obviously did his homework. The book has a dynamic storytelling at a breakneck pace, which is done with grace and a unique style.</p>

                <p>The love for reading has been there since childhood. From fairy tales to crime fiction, my school days got me into reading more often than not. Comics were one genre I consumed happily back then. I remember reading the witty tales of Akbar & Birbal as a series of comics. It was a delightful travel back in time as I re-read some of the tales that I loved back then in this book by Monisha Mukundan.The emperor was once lost in a forest and came to an intersection with three roads. Not knowing which road led back to his city, and facing a dilemma, he saw a young man coming down one of the roads. The manner of the young man’s reply endeared him to the Emperor who offered him a place in his court.</p>
